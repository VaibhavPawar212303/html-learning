    1.Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. 
    Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
    Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, 
    you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; 
    it can suddenly be removed or changed.

    2.Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not 
    include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. 
    Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. 
    Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

    Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling
    Use the HTML <style> element to define internal CSS
    Use the HTML <link> element to refer to an external CSS file
    Use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements

    Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
    Use the CSS border property for borders
    Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
    Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border

    HTML Links - Hyperlinks
    
    The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
    By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
        An unvisited link is underlined and blue
        A visited link is underlined and purple
        An active link is underlined and red
    
    HTML Links - The target Attribute
    By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. 
    To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
    The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
    The target attribute can have one of the following values:
        _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
        _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
        _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
        _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
    
    Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
    Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.
    A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):
    <h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>
    <h2>Relative URLs</h2>
    <p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></p>
    <p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>

    HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
    To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:
    <a href="default.asp">
    <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
    </a>

    Link to an Email Address
    Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):
    <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

    Button as a Link
    To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.
    JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:

    Use the HTML <map> element to define an image map
    Use the HTML <area> element to define the clickable areas in the image map
    Use the HTML usemap attribute of the <img> element to point to an image map

    Shape
    You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:
    rect - defines a rectangular region
    circle - defines a circular region
    poly - defines a polygonal region
    default - defines the entire region

    HTML Image Tags
    Tag	        Description
    <img>	    Defines an image
    <map>	    Defines an image map
    <area>	    Defines a clickable area inside an image map
